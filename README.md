# Type Error in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript: passing an array to a function expecting a string.  The code attempts to use an array as a string argument, resulting in a compilation error.
The solution shows how to correctly handle this by either modifying the function signature or adjusting the input to match the expected type.
This example highlights the benefits of TypeScript's static typing in catching potential errors before runtime.
